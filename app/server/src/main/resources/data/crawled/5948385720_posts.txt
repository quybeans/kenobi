Today is the first day of the process of me trying to change myself but that is so hard, changing the habits that you have been doing for years is not easy but I know it all going to be worth it at the end. Changing yourself for yourself is to make your own mind at peace and happy with whatever you have. Fake friends are always going to be fake friends is the matter of you trying to surround yourself with good people and today I also realized another thing is that QUIET is gold :)
