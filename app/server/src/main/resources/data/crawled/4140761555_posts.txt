Life is always full of adventures and lessons of course. We never know when is our last chance of doing something that we love, nor do we ever know how long the happiness will stay with us. Sometimes, I just wish I knew little bit of magic that enables me to freeze the time at certain moment. But, life doesn't exist with wishes. That's why dream is one of my favorite words in the vocabulary. Today, I took all the courage to say the words that I've never said before to one of  the persons I love the most in this whole planet. To me, that meant a milestone. Thanks God who has given me an opportunity to do this when it's still not too late. Unforgettable day#11.28.2017 when sunrise is up on the other side of the mountain & when the birds are singing, the dogs are barking all around the corners @ somewhere

Although it has actually been years since then, the memories still remain and yet gonna stay forever in me, someone else and some others ...

Too lazy to walk on the right track, then I decided to take the short cut. Good thing: walking time is less. But, what a wonderful gift from the smell of the trash bins located along the way. Too bad, but so good cuz right after walking out of the "shadow", I caught a delicious grilled meat smell. And, suddenly, I miss my mother's fried meat taste and smell so much!!!guess that's it!
