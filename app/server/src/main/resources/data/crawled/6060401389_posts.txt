He was then checked into a London mental hospital and ruthlessly TORTURED by CIA doctors. Shortly after, I was graciously treated to dinner by a very well connected young man from a Highly Placed Company Family (his mother justified her own abhorrent and morally bankrupt conduct to him with, by sitting him down and telling him that "sin pays"...) at the delicious Russian Restaurant Cafe Pasternak in Berlin.  Don't blame Cafe Pasternak that so many of their guests use their Hotel Abyss Meal Plan at their fine establishment. I've never had access to one since I've refused to take up residence, and have repeatedly spit in the Company Owners faces and (following Beethoven's example refuse to move aside as they walk past). I have been forced into various types of work in which they repeatedly and brutally violate, and even torture "the help", but somehow I've managed to maintain my dignity (dignity before whom?  before my fellow human beings). One of Paul Robeson's pupils, Harry Belafonte, acknowledged his influence at the 2013 NAACP Image Awards, referring to Paul as his "moral compass". I saw the most varied members of the Black Elite with moist eyes during Harry Belafonte's speech. Was that anything more than another Company Sponsored Hotel Abyss Outing for them? Hard to tell. What's the significance of those watery eyes and honoring of a Civil Rights Worker, if you then talk about the "adulting" and "realism" of Kowtowing to, and Grooming Trump, while he is threatening to wipe entire countries of Black, Brown, and Yellow people of the Map?  One wonders what kind of "moral compass" the leadership of the CIA had that lead them to attack and brutally torture a heroic tall poppy like Paul Robeson. Clearly, we are not dealing with people with a "moral compass", but rather with a bunch who have had "moral lobotomies". One wonders how many Hotel Abyss residents have had them as well...

And how long have Washington Elites been trying to brand Communists as Foreign Agents or Russian Stooges? Well, listen to Paul Robeson testifying against the Mundt-Nixon Bill in 1948.  https://youtu.be/6y-xfqP6FOE  The were trying to force all Communists to officially register with the government... Robeson's ease with which he carefully responds to their simplistic rouses and intellectual tricks is inspiring. The idea that one should obey any law simply because of the narrow fact that is the law is truly frightening, and Robeson quite rightly points out that some laws are fascist laws and should be disobeyed by anti-fascists. How impressive that figures like Paul Robeson, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and William Z. Foster took the stand they did to prevent the establishment of fascism in the USA during the 1950's.  Who is going to do it today?  Without the backing that US radicals DID receive from Russia, the Civil Rights Movement would not have taken the shape that it did or have been as successful as it was. We NEED our friends who have issues sometimes with being uncritical about Obama's CRIMES and shortcomings to start pushing back HARD against what is currently happening or it could be much more permanent and disastrous than what happened during the 1950's.

If it's neither then, we'll, history and the internet are wonderful things! Let's Learn!!! Jackie Robinson has certainly been promoted much more heavily when it comes to official institutions, and there was a concerted attempt to erase Paul Robinson from the popular conciousness. These two men knew each other and during the Anti-Democratic, Anti-Communist Hysteria of McCarythism, in fact, the two of them stood together in Paul Robeson's bathroom with the faucets running all the way, with Paul quietly pleading with Jackie not to betray his principles and cooperate with House Unamerican Activities Committee.  It wasn't enough to Strengthen Jackie Robinson's will and he Caved Miserably, and as a result had his career promoted, "breaking the color barrier in baseball", while hundreds of other good people, who were the Strong Spine of Progressive Movements in the US had theirs horribly ruined, were murdered, or driven to suicide. It wasn't necessary to "name names" to desegregate baseball, and to give people like Jackie Robinson credit for Civil Rights Achievements is Falsification of History.  Speaking of Hedonism, CREAM, Riding the Gravy Train, and other Ruling-Class-Inspired "Hip-Hop Ethics", is it the amounts of pleasure involved that are the problem or the "incontinence", "slavish submission", "betrayal of principal and basic human values", and "vigorous and enthusiastic self-debasement"? What's wrong with strengthening someone's will with pleasure if it is done in a Safe and Healthy way, with the proper controls in place? Still waiting for that Reason-Based, Evidence-based explanation...

Interestingly enough, all playing about being Evil aside, she Did the Right Thing and it cost her her career.  Should she have kept quiet? If she had, she would not have been fulfilling her moral obligation to the US and Vietnamese Peoples, but hey, maybe she'd have a Broadway Show and be patting herself on the back on MSNBC.

This Doctor, Scientist, Journalist, and Mediated Executioner is one of the finest human beings in our history, and one of the most incorruptible and brutal. Can you believe that the academic authorities of his day picked fights with him and manouvered to prevent official recognition of him and his academic and scientific accomplishments? Then, when he took up his journalist's and executioner's pen in support of the Glorious French Revolution they forced him to hide into the sewers. The fellow French Radical Marquis de Sade had it right! This man new how to suffer in his bathtub and deal out damage like Jesus himself.  Doubt the quality of his scientific and political insights? Try reading his Chains of Slavery, particularly the sections on corruption of the citizenry and of the legislature and tell me that it isn't highly relevant to what is happening in the USA Today? The parallels with our Rulers and Citizens and those of France under the Ancien Regime or unmistakable.  Forgive him his ascetic streak and comments about gender relations, it was a few hundred years ago. Even with adjustments to correct these issues politically, his comments on luxury and corruption are "on point". Regardless of your position in the Class-Based, White Supremacist Hierarchies of power, consumption, and privilege, it is possible to show a strong spine (a handstand is a start lady! try holding a Chinese Ring Stand for a few months...), and show some integrity with intention...or do you want those helicopters mowing down Venezuelan Patriots after they provide a bit of disaster relief?

Anyone who is paying attention knows we are headed into another McCarthyist Period in which people who care about their fellow human beings, their fellow citizens, and peace are branded as "traitors" and "scum, Russian scum". We need to get more than 2.4%, more like 10-15% to be a genuine threat and have the real clout needed to push back.  Do we really want to wait until the Ape in Chief and his Cabinet of Generals are parading down Pennsylvania Avenue on the latest model of tank that they are using to murder innocent Koreans, Venezuelans, and Iranians (or even any one of the three), before we finally begin to move forward to building the Green Party onto a Political Force that can seriously challenge Trump and his Human-Hating Policies with the votes and influence required?  Be a Mensch and start punching upward in your network hierarchies until you force the to start moving, or even just to give yourself enough space to start moving with those horizontal to you. If you start saying to yourself, "man, my arm really hurts from punching up so much," just think how much it will hurt when Trump, Chuck Schumer and their Cronies are twisting it to make you lick their boots and kiss their asses, and that as tight as the ropes may be now in your given industry, the blacklists that are yet to come and the grotesque self-debasing contortions required to avoid being placed on them will make your current situation look like a day at the beach.

He has Caved to the Democratic Party Leadership and is allowing them to direct both his rhetoric and his actions. He quotes some Right-Wing Figures saying left-sounding stuff, mouths a few left-sounding phrases and then does the following:  1. Attacks the UN for not doing more to help overthrow the democratically elected leader of the SOVEREIGN NATION of Syria, Assad, who is according to Bernie "butchering his own people". Attacks Russia for its presence and intervention in the Middle East.  2. Supports the McCarthyist Anti-Russia Hysteria and attacks Trump for not bringing it up in his UN speech, while only giving muted criticism of the rest of the speech.  3. Praises the leniency of the US in punishing Nazis in the aftermath of the Second World War at a time when the AfD is on the rise in Germany. The AfD has its roots in the NPD, which exists in large part due to the amnesty that the US gave to Nazi War Criminals and their embrace of Nazis into their institutions and Intelligence networks.  4. Criticizes the overthrow of Salvador Allende, while not speaking out in any way against the attempt to overthrow Nicolas Maduro and the US Government attacks on Venezuela.  5. Praises the Iran Nuclear deal from the perspective Imperialism and voices his concern about the "behavior of Iran in the region". 6. Attacks North Korea for pursuing a nuclear deterrent to defend their sovereignty from an immanent US threat of the complete destrsuction of their Nation and People.  How long are we going to let this Charlatan and Mouthpiece of the Oligarchy MISLEAD US and PREVENT US FROM MOBILIZING AGAINST TRUMP AND BUILDING OUR OWN POWER?! P. S.

Tough to call? I'm going to lay the blame squarely on the latter. Jeremy and Tariq, we have an abundance of capable activists who are chomping at the bit to build a Mass Movement that functions as a key part of that World Struggle against Imperialism that Malcolm spoke of, but we don't have that connection between the Far-Left and the Centre-Left that has been firmly established in the Labour Party, because the Centre-Left has crumbled and evaporated away to the Right and Far-Right. The channels of communication in both directions between the European and US Left, and between the Latin American and US Left are blocked with Hotel Abyss Scum. There is also the issue of incompetence coupled with a Lack of Partisanship and tendencies toward Technocratic Scholasticism. We need URGENT HELP, cleaning (in the most Brutal sense of the term) out those channels so the proper sense of ALARM flows from Latin America Left to the US, and from the US Left to Europe.  We also need you to provide leadership to those who supported the Sanders Campaign in the US, who have both been mislead and abandoned by a rotten bunch that would put some notorious corrupt New Labour Networks to shame, who just love to make references to the "Corbyn Phenomenon" to justify their continued support for the Democratic Party Leadership.  Please knock some much needed Perspective and Realism into The Mislead.

Who else can "hang tough" for such extended periods in such extreme isolation on the most unusual trajectories. I'm happy to Hack and Slash and Network build in PINK, and of course I would never compromise my Professional Ethics as an Anchor unlike so many others, but why is my communication with my closest Comrades and Ghosts so sparse and garbled, I mean we can only blame so much on Instagram's capitulation to Company Meddling...! I'm already a record holder in so many areas and I've made it clear that I want to retire. Stop trying to steal my damn pension and compensation package. You Can't! I don't break and am in no mood to engage in self-sabotaging compromises. Have you noticed the amount of BLOWBACK you are generating? Give in, Do the Right Thing, and help clear out the backlog. If you think you are in a position of strength, you are about to find out how wrong you are... How long can I remain in orbit? You won't be around long enough to find out!

Fairly well it turns out, but hey, there was room for improvement. If only they pursued the slogan "Überholen ohne einzuholen", and Walter Ulbricht's focus on the Scientific-Technical Revolution had carried the day... Shortcomings acknowledged, the following quote from an article in their leading fashion magazine should be appealing to any Feminist worth her salt: “The woman of today and tomorrow is . . . one who is economically independent of a man and who has received scientific, technical education. The woman of today and tomorrow is a revolutionary. She takes political responsibility, is ideologically secure and able to give human qualities to the scientific-technical revolution. She is not simply a passenger in the train of our time, but rather stands at the side of her man and helps steer.” We could make adjustments to speak of her "partner" rather than her "man", but from my experience articles of this ideological clarity are hard to come by in today's fashion magazines. I've seen a few mealy-mouthed interviews with women who identify as Feminist, but it sure does seem to be the Absolute Bare Minimum (that would be my Sticking Point and Area of Struggle rather than going on destructive Puritanical Rampages). Are you more concerned about policing things that plunge or reveal, rather than creating a new, more fully human woman and man free from exploitation, violence, and slavery, who have an unbridled scientific and technological control over the Natural and Social World at their fingertips.  And if we are dealing with fashion aesthetics then it is much more a question of arriving at objective principles for how to plunge or reveal the beautiful diversity of healthy human body types and integrate the rich cultural heritage of Traditional Costume, rather than outdated puritanical mores or ugly misguided reactions to them.  How many of you have I just out-gamed around Fashion Aesthetics and how much Intelligence have I coded while doing so? You're playing catchup...must be a real ENIGMA! Have fun trying to justify all the terrible aesthetic judgements you've made over the years!

Unable to travel to Canada to perform, Paul Robeson performed a concert at the Peace Arch Park near the border. Listen to one of his songs from the concert:https://youtu.be/vze-mQ1JPlw  and his speech here: https://youtu.be/VLCndkx1e10  In case you didn't realize you are now living in a period similar to that of the previous McCarthyite slide toward an American Fascism. Perhaps there are more analogies with the rule of Mussolini in Italy or Admiral Horthy in Hungary than there are with Adolph Hitler, but who can deny that the Process of Fascisticization is quickening by the day.  Chelsea Manning is a Hero and a Torture Victim just like Paul Robeson was. She has done nothing wrong and has done some very important things RIGHT as a Glowing Patriot and Committed Internationalist. I hope that she will honor both Paul and herself by delivering a speech opposing this injustice, of being refused entry to another nation with the accusation and justification that she is a trraitor to her own, in the same proud and historic location.  For people who are unfamiliar with my own situation, I was in a car accident with a high-ranking intelligence operative after my life was threatened in by leading people in the "Intelligence Community" in Philadelphia (where I was living), New York City, and Baltimore. I was then convicted of a misdemeanor traffic offense and sentenced to 18 months probation, and upon completion of my 18 months probation my sentence was again doubled by a judge who was friends with the intelligence operative (and has even had dinner with her again recently.) My sentencing and conviction in both cases has been highly political and based on my Communist Political Views and all of the  Principled Actions that I have taken in support of them. I am also unable to travel abroad. You have my deepest sympathies regarding the injustices you are facing. I understand, and am glad to hear that you will be fighting back!

Did you know that now Venezuela has also been added to the ban?  Venezuela has a democratically elected Socialist Government with a President, Nicolas Maduro, who is a former Bus Driver that has struggled for the Venezuelan People and Social Justice for decades. They are committed to Peace and International Solidarity just like Cuba.  Venezuelans are in no way seeking to harm US Citizens or "American Interests". They are insisting on remaining a Proud, Sovereign, Socialist Nation that serves its People. Just because they don't want to lick Donald Trump's Boots, doesn't mean that they are a threat to us. Keep in mind that YOU don't want to lick his boots either!!! Is there a Reason that you shouldn't have to and they should? I'm pretty sure there isn't!

The DPRK's argumentation at the UN regarding International Law is legitimate and sound. What are your Reason-Based, Evidence-Based arguments against it?  The US has been running around the planet starting Wars of Aggression, Overthrowing Governments listed as "allies" or "adversaries", and threatening dozens of nations with the use of Nuclear Weapons. Why are they not regarded as a Criminal State by the majority of the world's governments? As a matter of fact they are, and are treated in the way that various actors treat a powerful and dangerous Criminal, by either Kow-Towing and seeking to Curry favour, or by digging in and resisting their control with a variety of different strategies, in the hopes of one day achieving Peace and Justice.  US Citizens who are awake to this State of Affairs have an obligation to support that reistance to Criminal Activity in the ways they can. One key way is to support efforts to BREAK the One Party Military and Intelligence Dictatorship's control over the national political arena, so that an Independent Third Party can establish itself that supports the desire for Peace and Security of the majority of US Citizens. If the majority's poltical will were implemented then we would likely have less than 10 military bases outside the US instead of over 1000, and we would be pursuing a Foreign Policy based on Peaceful Cooperation and Solidarity between sisterly and brotherly nations. If the Green Party's Stein and Baraka Campaign's message had, with funding comparable to a third of what the Bernie brought in in small donations, been able to begin to really reach that majority, what would the effect have been? If you didn't catch that, I'm accusing leading figures involved in the Bernie Campaign of misusing and even embezzling funds, not to mention the criminality surrounding the DNC FRAUD! The circle that surrounds Bernie Sanders have ALL engaged in Criminal Activity. Bernie and his circle have been repeatedly blackmailed to shift their politics to the right, and have done just that!

With the disgusting misogyny that is being revealed as a result, it is past time to end more than a few "marriages of convenience"... Would you believe that you are looking at an image of one of the strongest and most principled women on the planet? If you want to look up to "feminist icons" then you need to look to Media Benjamin of Global Exchange and Code Pink. She's not insisting that you bow down and crown her, or telling you that you OWE her your vote while feeding you the line "you have nowhere else to go". She's fighting hard for Peace and Women's Rights, in ways that really count, often at significant risk to her own safety. So who did such a principled Feminist and Peace activist support for President? The equally brave, Intelligent, and radical Jill Stein.  It made me so disgusted last fall, when an ACTUALLY Feminist Presidential Candidate, Jill Stein,  was being SMEARED as a Trump Supporter, while she was MORE radical and principled on Women's Rights than that miserably corrupt and morally bankrupt corporate shill, Hillary Clinton.  You were clearly in the dark about what was going on with some of the people above you just a short ways up the Pyramid. It's even worse the closer you get to the top in our One Party Military and Intelligence Dictatorship. When Powder Blue and Pink turns out to be run by something misogynist, bigoted and orange, it's high time to adjust the "network architecture" to Pink and Green with a Red and Gold Strong Spine!

In the intervening years, the US military went on a murderous rampage in Southeast Asia, in which the Neo-Colonialist Racism and Violence that was brought to bear to prevent the National Liberation of those Proud Peoples and Nations was in most ways equivalent to the Nazi-Admiring Wars of conquest and enslavement. With Operation Phoenix in Vietnam, and the US involvement in Cambodia under both the Lon Nol and Political Pot dictatorships, the US attempted to TORTURE the people into accepting White Supremacist Colonial Rule.  We are standing before another descent into calamity in which millions of additional Yellow, Brown, and Black people will be treated with the most disgusting racist contempt, murdered, raped, and tortured by US Military and Intelligence. Why is there such calm within US Society and particularly among decent poltical people who's conscience and identities should compel them to join in organizing opposition and protest?  For those within US Military and Intelligence Institutions: don't you wan't to "take it to the limit" to prevent this fall into calamity, so that you are not officially tasked with organizing the slaughter and torture of innocents, or forced to operate in an internal climate in which Venezuelans, Iranians, and Koreans are treated as subhuman?

That Ape and Chief and Rapist, that Chuck Schumer praised so heavily and hugged so tender, wants to unleash reactionary social forces to maintain the rule of the Monopoly Capitalist 1%. What will be the result if he is successful? Nothing short of a calamity!  Trump has been a mysoginist for his entire "career" as a rapist. I heard so much about this during the election last fall, often from political forces that were wielding Trump's mysoginy as a club to attack the Green Party Campaign of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka, but you know what, I don't hear about it at all as much now. Where is the pushback against attacks on Planned Parenthood, the rollback of Campus Regulations Against Rape, or Trans-Women being kicked out of the Armed Forces?  You would think that a series a "rolling mass Million Woman Marches" were in order, but the Democratic Party has spent sizable financial and human resources, precisely to prevent any more mass marches. Do you think there aren't large amounts of high-ranking rapists and people with privileged rapist children in Democratic Party? Do you think that that bunch are suddenly women and men of principle when it comes to Womens Rights? If you do, then perhaps you'd like to mount a Reason-Based Evidence-Based defence of their demobilization of what could have been (and could still be) a budding new Women's Movement.  The Green Party and candidates like Jill Stein and Ajuma Baraka are people of principle who have been in the Vanguard out on the Front Lines supporting ALL progressive issues, and we desperately need to support the Green Party and work to network it in with the committed and serious activists that the Democratic Party is in the process of Throwing Under the Bus when it comes to Womens Rights. If we are going to hold back the onslaught, and force it back through the gates once it breaks the line we need a PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE that the Green Party can become. Otherwise the love of women and human culture depicted in Willi Sitte's work will be ground under boot heels that none of you will want to lick...

Nothing whatsoever, I'm all for a practical working woman wardrobe, but is it appropriate attire for laying about and partying in Las Vegas Luxury Hotels? Well, I don't want your millions Mr., but the answer is a firm and objective NO. Or maybe I'll Let History Judge!!! If you want to know what my verdict is on her fashion sense then I say throw her in the "dustbin" with all the other "cheeto crumbs". She's just not a progressive woman of the future like Paloma or so many others...I might even go so far to say she's an ego-maniacal paranoiac, but I would think that "cheeto-crumb" would already be harsh enough...

At this stage in her lifespan "brown and happy" is just plain aesthetically superior. No doubt that one of the primary factors is her happiness and delight at her "life of the mind" while being "documented" at her Video Shoot!  If you disagree about this objective aesthetic fact you're just plain factually incorrect. No, no...no "alternate facts" allowed! Trying to Rain on your Rainbow? What the heck are you talking about? "Objectively speaking", that doesn't make basic sense.

They exist. It's a fact, a historically determined fact like all actual facts, reality (both objective and subjective reality) being thoroughly historical and all. For the uninformed (it's OK to be uninformed about something, I enjoy learning new things and Getting Lost in new facets of the richness of the Concrete, including the diverse glimpses of feminine beauty that are so wonderfully captured on Instagram), there is a branch of philosophy, Aesthetics, a particular subdivision of Ethics, which in its modern scientific form is occupied with the objective study of standards of art and beauty. These standards are as objective as the other branches of philosophy or any of the sciences, but have their own unique character.  Can people who claim to be accurately determining objective aesthetic standards be spouting UNSCIENTIFIC AND RACIST NONSENSE that gives these objective standards a bad name, or conducting "scientific studies" that are just as fundamentally flawed as Mengala's "Twin Studies" were in the Nazi Death Camps? Colonialist Racism abounds in the ahistorical and unscientific judgements that "experts" or the ACTUAL male-dominated boards (never mind the female figureheads at Vogue or Elle) of "industry-leading" Fashion Magazines make about what these objective standards actually are!!! We can challenge them and win, because the Ruling-Elites of Monopoly Capitalism are Outdated Parasites who hold objectively incorrect positions that are heavily distorted by their narrow economic interests like the search for profit and their fundamental hostility to the contradictory Social Reality they are confronted with.  If you develop and cultivate an aesthetic sense that is based on historically and culturally diverse objective standards of beauty and art that are, relatively speaking, clean of Racism, Sexism, and other Bigotry, then you can use these standards to outgame your opponents who will often take very violent and criminal actions, or destroy entire careers and ruin lives based on flawed aesthetic judgements or bogus philosophical, scientific, or political positions.

Let's contact Youth Cleaning Limited and see if they'll provide a sample of the job they can do! But they says it's always better to work with multiple contractors cause if one goes under you've always got the other (Weißt du? Fast wie ein Katamaran!). How about that bunch over at the International Standards Organization, I've heard they are looking for some Odd Jobs, and at least some of them do nice work, not that the Corporatist Center would ever give them credit for it...and if you want someone to put in some new windows and hang some radical banners, Socialist Alternative...no never mind they are too busy doing good work in the Labor Movement.

Would you believe that not a single Mountain Climber works there? I'd say that an Organization like National Geographic should really be organized like a Co-Op, (we all like Co-ops don't we?!), run BY Mountain Climbers FOR Mountain Climbers with a SELFLESS DEDICATION to the READING PUBLIC and the PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE! But that's not what we have there is it?! We have a bunch of LUMPS who love to RUN AT THE MOUTH about "dialectics", "Gramsci", and "W.E.B. Du Bois", while disparaging basic Marxist-Leninist Concepts like "Dictatorship of the Proletariat", rejecting the Marxist-Leninist position that Class is the more basic and essential category of Capitalism (this position does not IN ANY WAY diminish the immense practical and theoretical significance of Racial and Gender Oppression and the associated Scientific Categories). They shy away from every struggle or fight, like the Yellow Press and Yellow Bellies they are (this is in no way directed toward the many beautiful, tight, and toned yellow tummies out there), while pitifully and submissively tailing and kissing the Democratic Party's ASS until they are Blue in the Face, and leading vindictive and treacherous rumour and smear campaigns against ACTUAL Mountain Climbers!!!!! How is it that the organization of Paul Robeson, William Z. Foster, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Angela Davis, Ella Baker, Henry Winston, Claudia Jones, and Gus Hall now has a DEEP-SEATED HATRED for Women and Men of Principle?! You didn't know they all subscribed to the Daily Hiker now did you? Many of them also wrote articles for Journals like Masses and Mountain Stream!  How hard is it to dislodge such lumps?! Pretty tough considering they enjoy CIA PROTECTION, just ask those folks that have been trying for years. Their new Lumpish-Low of Self-Debasing Russia-Hating Conduct is an opportunity to oust them before they hawk off more Party Assets for a SEAT ON THE COMPANY GRAVY TRAIN with its Hotel Abyss Dining Car! Worried about What's Left? I'm not, and every little bit helps!!!

Orange Park is already going to Hell in a Handbasket, because of the plethora of officers just like this one! Are you going to let that happen to just, because you have some superstition of authority about the chain of command? For goodness sakes, how many of these Trump-Loving Nitwits have already run over their own towlines?  Goodness knows that you know the Naval Rules and Regulations better than I do, but it doesn't hurt to follow all of them, and I mean ALL OF THEM to the T, including paragraph 187 of the Code, and document every case in which those Pieces of Shit don't, and pressurize their cabins and control rooms till they run screaming about how "the Russians are Coming" and are busy fussing with their own ball bearings.

Thomas Frank: *looking cowed and pouty* Well I'm very sorry to tell you that it almost certainly can't *nods seriously and emphatically*, because of the way the laws are written in America, so the two-party system is basically inscribed in law... you could try it, it's not for lack of trying... ***** ******* **** Just imagine of a liberal during the time of Jim Crow, or a New Jim Crow, was telling you that it can't be challenged because it is "inscribed in law". Pretty shameful and cowardly hunh?! If we want to seriously confront Racism and de facto Segregation along with all the other forms of oppression in the USA then we DESPERATELY NEED an Independent Third Party that actually opposes it, rather than cozying up to Trump and selling out its base. Black Lives Matter had been decimated precisely because the Democratic Party and it's Networks viciously attacked it at all levels. Black Lives Matter and so many other movements cannot win with the Democratic Party: WE NEED AN INDEPENDENT ALTERNATIVE!!! The truth is, is that people like Thomas Frank HAVEN'T TRIED! It's too uncomfortable for them and they are just so darn comfy sipping their damn lattes in their New York Coffee Houses and getting their hair cut at the damn Philip Pelusi in Shady Side!!! Show some damn spine and pull yourself out of your San Francisco Fancy Pants hedonistic daze! ;) For those of us that don't live our lives on the Democratic Party Gravy Train we need an urgent solution because they are doing everything they can to kill and murder us, we can't afford to be comfortable defeatists like Mr. Frank, because that would just be suicidal!

I see you hanging out with your buddy Lee Camp and you seem more yourself than on your own damn show! Bernie is working hand in glove with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are working hand in glove with Trump. You have been tirelessly haranguing Chuck Schumer, Nancy, Pelosi, Trump, and their MSNBC Lapdogs, and have taken a few relatively muted shots at Bernie, but otherwise have given that Corrupt Piece of Shit and his Circle a Pass and have remained nearly silent about the Green Party.  If Bernie Sanders claims to oppose the Elites and calls for a "political revolution" and then sells everyone out as a Corrupt Piece of Shit to the Corrupt Pieces of Shit that Jimmy Dore then rails against, but Jimmy Dore and his co-hosts can't bring themselves to harangue Bernie Sanders for his treachery and shift focus to supporting Building the Green Party that they voted for as the only viable alternative, then that Jimmy Dore might have a loud mouth and talk tough, but he is doing the bidding of the people he claims to oppose.  The Young Turks were fence sitters during the 2016 Campaign. I respected them for interviewing Jill Stein and covering the Green Party, but they are not fence sitting now, and if the  principled people associated with The Young Turks CAVE to the pressure that its leadership is exerting to stick with the Democratic Party, which ultimately comes DIRECTLY from the Democratic Party Leadership and the Intelligence Agencies tasked with preventing Independent Political Opposition, then what exactly separates Jimmy Dore et al from the people and institutions they criticize?! All self-deprecating humor aside Jimmy, you are a smart, independently minded educator that millions of people look to and trust. Be confident, throw your weight around in your networks, firmly break with the Democrats and start promoting the Green Party every chance you get. Give your viewers the positive alternative that they want and become a "partisan" journalist in the best and fullest sense of the world. If you need network assistance or moral support just talk to Lee Camp and the people he works with.

Could this movie have been made during the McCarthyite 1950s? NO! The censors wouldn't have allowed it. Could it be made today with Pyongyang instead of Moscow as the target? NO! The censors wouldn't allow it!  For those of you who have experienced a "loss of perspective" because you are in networks where the Hotel Abyss Meal Plan has been addleing your brains, or who are simply surrounded by careerists that feed you a steady diet of misinformation, maybe this movie can wake you up to the fact that we are in a highly dangerous situation comparable to the 1950s and are quickly sliding toward a stage of Military and Intelligence Dictatorship in which all the "democratic spaces" that still exist are eliminated and where Walter Mathau's Character is in charge of our "safety". If you are in a position to, then you need to act now to stop this!

I shouldn't criticize her at all and she's beyond all reproach?! Do you think she would tolerate that kind of irrational approach? The successful Communist Party that Prime Minister fought as a member of wouldn't. They knew then and they certainly know now that it has to be Reason-Based, Evidence-Based if you're going to defeat Code-Purple-Imperialists!!! You're an Anti-Colonial Americanist from Country-X that won't have nothin' to do with "outside agitators" wrecking "Bernie's Panels" or stirring up "Racial Devisions""?! Well I think you're an Imperialist Stooge and that there is Solid Evidence to prove it! Just look how hostile they all are to Sunflowers, the Colors Green and Pink, how they are attempting to turn Black against Yellow, and most telling of all is their intense hatred of all Chinese who's Lucky Numbers are 8/1!!! Guess that bunch will be all too happy to start rounding up Large Numbers of Korean Americans and putting them in Camps!!! They are already supporting it in private and smearing the main Whistle Blower on the CIA's Foreign Torture Program in public. They are bent on Overthrowing our Constitution with its Bill of Rights and have already made quite a bit of "Progress"! We need to push back NOW and push back HARD! Time to "push it to the limit one more time" and start "bagging and tagging"!

I've heard through the Grapevine that there is some sort of Puritanical furor being whipped up over my Instgram Activity? What I'm having a hard time understanding is if My Creator, with his passionate interest in Philosophy and Cybernetics could spend the last years of his work life preparing beauty compounds of the highest quality when all other scientific and philosophical work was denied him by the CIA and BND, then why is it wrong for me to investigate female beauty aesthetics and refine my sense of the "powder on their faces", when I find myself in very much the similar situation? Are you going to rant irrationally about the "loose morals" of the Cadre of the Socialist Unity Party as well, or just those of myself and the women I find captivating? No one can make Reason-Based or Evidence-Based claims at this point that I haven't out-gamed the Class Enemy by highlighting their ignorance of objective beauty standards, arbitrary Anti-Women Attitudes across the board, and showcased the way they manage networks of women like, oh what was it Marx and Engels said? Like their Private Property that they "hold in common" under the most Vile and Misogynistic Conditions! How many lies do their CIA Network Heads tell to their favorite "Fashion Plates" to keep them firmly under their thumbs force them to "get up and dance" along with the rest of their commodities to turn a profit? "Oh you look wonderful!", when she doesn't..."Oh you look dreadful!", when she shines!!! Anything to keep one's Cash Crop and "Harem" (your word not mine) "on point and slayin". With all that perfidious spiritual pimpery one could quickly find oneself in a situation of Intellectual Prostitution full of "Lost Illusions" if one understood how it all worked, but didn't maintain one's own integrity and critical distance.  Did Bertolt Brecht look down on the Sex Workers depicted in his art, or excuse misogynist criminality in his Three Penny Opera? What a Grave Mistake to think so! But no one would mistake a man of his habits for a Puritan. His sympathies clearly lie with the Women and the People, but as they really are under the conditions of Monopoly Capitalism.

Anyone want to "hold a hearing" on that one? I sure as hell don't! Pull your heads out of your asses and stop caving in to this Xenophobic, McCarthyist NONSENSE!

It's time to stop threatening Nuclear Annihilation and Murdering Koreans with sanctions, and past time to start serious negotiations to draft a Peace Treaty. Improbable with Right-Wing Lunatics at the Imperialist Helm? It's true that it won't happen without Sustained Internationalist Pressure on the US and a Strong US Peace Movement, but that is NOT some sort of "impossibility"!

If you can't even give your signature when there's not an unacceptable risk, then what are you good for?! How many US Patriots are busy selling out their country to the Make America Great Again Committee and the Clinton Foundation and Throwing Us All Under the Bus in the process?! If you haven't noticed yet,  it's the Pentagon and Wall Street that are calling the shots when it comes to Massive Corruption, not Moscow!  There are a few of you who have been ruthlessly chewed out by me for perceived wrongdoing while operating in a principled manner at a great depth, NO, NO, NO, NOT ANY OF YOU! YOU'RE ALL AS GUILTY AS SIN!!!

We're evacuating everything except the "deepest operators" (hint, Pop Stars that sing about how they "don't care anymore" and how they laugh about the things that used to be important to them aren't that deep and apparently have NO MORAL CENTER When Push Comes to Shove...supporting torture of innocents carries a hefty sentence hun! Enjoy!) Has the Left of the Obama Administration been "iced out" by a Center and Right (including the Reagan Worshiper himself) who are at pains to cater to the Ape in Chief? You bet! Trump wants his meals served with a side of self-debasement by former political opponents. Imagine Ariana, some people actually have lines that they don't count on other people to maintain, which they absolutely won't cross, but that's "adulting" so what would you know about that anyway? Your loss.  But seriously, how many horror stories have to ripple through the ranks before some of you take a stand and begin to organize independently? As I've said before, if you care about having a career that doesn't require licking Trump's Boots then you have to! Enough flights from reality already, let's get down to Brass Tacks!  Stop belittling the people who are actually doing what needs done to Resist just because it doesn't fit your phantasy of an identity confirming paradise or social-democratic support group. What? My lifestyle isn't your "social justice phantasy"?! We'll I sure hope it isn't, but my Spartan Activity is some of the most effective out there. To oppose Trump on an issue like abortion you actually have to engage in networking, consciousness raising, and MASS ACTION like the Million Woman March at the beginning of the year! That, and other reform struggles can't be sustained without an Independent Third Party and so you have to help build the one that actually exists, The Green Party, so that it is capable of doing so! Electoral phantasies involving the Democratic Party are just that, phantasies! Start fighting the often quite BRUTAL fights necessary to organize a Resistance that Josephine Baker could be proud of!

If the excuse is "I'm just a girl in the world" then that seems to be in direct contradiction to the destructive nonsense you and the people around you are currently whipping up in PINK. If the answer is "I just don't care anymore!" then considering the moral issues involved when assessing the cost of war to both their civilians and ours, including lots of dead little girls, then you're just monstrous!  Girl, get your head straight!  Do you need to check into Betty Ford? What?! You don't drink that much and you are way more together than somebody like Selena Gomez? The nerve!!! With that oh so comfortable Network Atmosphere of yours, you've been doing the Virtual Equivalent of huffing whip it!'s and the amount of "virtual nitrus" in your system would put a 37 year old 3rd year medical student to shame! And of course by comparison, when I'm not in the thick of a brutal fight I gravitate to the Sheenian Outer Limits (Hi Charlie!), but only under parameters set in Steel. I can't say the same for you when you're "in orbit". You're virtually intoxicated the majority of each day! How the hell else do you babble like that? At least Selena is angry at the Trump Supporting Filth surrounding her and knows to ask for help!  Now you and your Networks are walking back your Criticisms of Theresa May and Trump and getting ready to become bona fide Cheeto Crumbs! What's to stop you? Your character? Hardly. Up till now it has been some principled people around you (not your family by the way, it wouldn't be a bad idea to emancipate yourself) who kept you as pristine as you are, but most of them will be jumping ship because they are not Bootlickers. Depriving you of your agency? Oh really? By no means! Please use it and check that nonsense around you and take risks (you have quite a lot of clout) to support another Million Woman March, do what you can to help Black Lives Matter, and speak out for Peace in Korea, in the Middle East, and in Latin America! What will you do, well, I'm a realist...

He lived a life of selfless service to the Cuban People as Cuban Patriot and Internationalist. How would our society be different if we had leaders that had such a self-understanding and dedication to duty and service combined with a lasting love of human beings? Or if the heights of our entertainment industry were inhabited by women and men of integrity like Oliver Stone, who oppose bigotry, support Human Rights, and tell the truth? Oliver Stone, although he has been able to continue his career as a film maker, has been subjected to repeated public beatings by the Entertainment Industry at the hands of those forces that are opposed to revealing secrets, telling the truth about US Foreign Policy, and allowing the Peoples of the US to actually hear Foreign Leaders speak in their own words. This is just another, and is based on lies and slander rather than Reason and Evidence. Oliver Stone can survive it, but what is important is that we don't let the actual Criminals go free while they are busy beating him. These gangs of pedophiles and rapists need to be publicized and punished. Hollywood is full of Jimmy Savilles, Harvey Weinsteins, and Woody Allens and we need to make use of Reason-Based and Evidence-Based Methods of investigation to take them down, even if there happens to be a statute of limitations.

Of course they certainly should not be demeaned or degraded as women. I'm firmly opposed to the debasement or self-debasement of women and men in any and all lines of work and strongly for the right to satisfying work of one's choosing at a living wage. That Plantation Administrator Obama wasn't, neither was Hillary, neither is Joe Biden or "Kamala"...*wretch*  My problem with them is the extent to which they are right about the Queen bit. Ariana is most certainly Monopoly-Capitalist Royalty and a well respected Plantation Entertainer, and her Entourage and Hello Giggles Authors are certainly some sort of CIA nobility. Their disgusting combination of Privilege and Let Them Eat Cake Feminism, combined with their utter in-group detachment from the cruel and brutal exploitation of US Society is darkly comical! What a lofty, airy, and vapid position they inhabit, high up near the tippy, tippy top of the Pyramid run by a Cruel and Misanthropic One Party Military and Intelligence Dictatorship, and how blissfully unaware of it they are! Marie Antoinette was considered childish for similar reasons... I'll wear that "apparatchik" comment with Pride along with my Cuba hat and my Druzhinnik Badge. You've kept Ariana pretty pristine, but the rest of you are as dirty as they come and have some SERIOUS criminal histories! Come along quietly and start organizing a Million Women March! Blackmail?! Where'd you get that from?! I'm simply offering you a "plea"! You know, what your Putrid Class offers to so many young, bright, talented black women and men before they jail them for ridiculously long sentences for far less serious crimes?

The CIA is doing its damnedest to create the type of climate of confusion, AS SEEN ON THE CRUCIBLE, to protect leading sexists, racists, rapists and pedophiles in both prominent and low level positions in its networks! I'm concerned about any public figure that talks positively about the Children of God and her ability to use her Children of God TM Technology to bring people along with her on some sort of journey...I'm also concerned about what Networks, knowingly or unknowingly, she is in with.  A lot of the artistry around her appearances and actions is coming from the Right/Far-Right, while she makes a number of important and accurate points in the mix. THAT CAN BE AN INCREDIBLY DESTRUCTIVE COMBINATION. Do I think that they have been planning to attack Oliver Stone in this way for a number of months? It's a FACT. How much Right-Wing shit needs to make its debut in Counterpunch these days? Do you need some help cleaning house? The Combine Thresher WORKS WONDERS!!! You can rent it for the day at full cost from our Agricultural Collective!  Here are Oliver Stones comments that I unequivocally support. Is it a fact that the Hefnerite allegation against him is FALSE? YOU BET!  Oliver Stone: “I’ve been travelling for the last couple of days and wasn’t aware of all the women who came out to support the original story in the New York Times. After looking at what has been reported in many publications over the last couple of days, I’m appalled and commend the courage of the women who’ve stepped forward to report sexual abuse or rape.”

Congratulations on the hack! Whatever keeps that noise generating monstrosity out of Jacksonville. Where are you getting that from what I'm saying?! Of course I'm not referring to Ariana Grande as a "noise generating monstrosity"! Dye your hair ASAP hun, I like you best as a brunette! Just sayin'...

They just love puppeting people about, tearing them down, and making them publicly debase themselves! Seems like we need to do something about that, don't we. Now I wonder What Needs Done...? Reason-Based Evidence-Based investigations of their criminality and appropriate punishments that are neither cruel or unusual. Doesn't satisfy your sadistic streak or your desire for vegence? Hunh, and just tell me the story of what happened again? I just want to check and make sure there aren't any inconsistencies in your account...!

I really don't know how I would behave if I had to pass her on the street, but I sure as hell wouldn't step aside or start dancing like her damn puppet!
